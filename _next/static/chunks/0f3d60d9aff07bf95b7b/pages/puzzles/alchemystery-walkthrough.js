The player gains access to the Cauldron after the introduction, and after that almost all puzzles revolve around brewing different potions in the Cauldron. To brew a potion, you need to put three ingredients into the Cauldron, and then stir it. The order the ingredients are added to the Cauldron matters, and if even one ingredient is not in order, the potion won't work. The developers of the game claim that there's a \"unifying underlying logic\" to the potions, but I can't figure anything out so the lazy devs must be lying.\n\n===B:FAQ===\n\n[001]: Royal Garden\nQ: When I try to sneak past the monstrous plant in the Royal Garden, it spits water at me!\n\nA: The monstrous plant is loyal only to the dead queen, and you need to trick it into thinking that the queen is there. Brew the following potion:\n\n1. Haunted Painting\n2. Spring Water\n3. Elmwood\n\nThen, use this potion. It will summon the ghost of the dead queen, which will haunt the plant and get it to stop spitting water.\n\n[002]: Chase Sequence\nQ: Whenever I break out of the prison, the warden always catches me on horseback!\n\nA: You need to make the warden's stone horse slippery so that she slips when she tries to get on it. (It's made of stone, so it's already pretty slippery...) In the prison, brew the following potion:\n\n1. Olive Oil\n2. Normal Rock\n3. Aged Meat\n\nUse this potion when you escape to lube up the warden's horse and later the warden will not be able to catch you.\n\n[003]: \"Fishing\"\nQ: I need to be able to catch the fish in the boiling lake!\n\nA: The solution does not involve a fishing rod or anything silly like that. Instead, use the following potion:\n\n1. Packaged Lightning\n2. Red Hot Chili Pepper\n3. Spring Water\n\nThis will electrify the lake and kill the fish, allowing you to easily collect them.\n\n[004]: \"Fishing\" again\nQ: I need to be able to catch the fish in the Grease Geyser!\n\nA: Just like before, you need to electrify the body of liquid - this time it's full of hot oil. Use this potion:\n\n1. Packaged Lightning\n2. Red Hot Chili Pepper\n3. Olive Oil\n\nJust like in the boiling lake, the fish will be electrocuted and float to the surface for easy collection.\n\n[005]: Barred Door\nQ: I can't open the door to the Ghost Dimension because of the bar on the door!\n\nA: The metal bar on the door is extremely heavy, far too heavy to be lifted normally. Use the following potion:\n\n1. Turbulent Air\n2. Weighted Sphere\n3. Untempered Steel\n\nThe bar will levitate and allow you to open the door.\n\n[006]: Barred Door II\nQ: I need to close the barred door to the Ghost Dimension to stop the ghouls from following me in!\n\nA: You need to freeze the heavy metal bar in order to get it to stop levitating and land again. Use the following potion:\n\n1. Iced Coffee\n2. Weighted Sphere\n3. Untempered Steel\n\nThe bar will freeze and drop back into place.\n\n[007]: Fire Puzzle\nQ: I'm stuck on the puzzle in the Fire Temple!\n\nA: This puzzle stumped us for the longest time - we were trying to figure out how to get fire to spread correctly and everything. It turns you you don't need any of that, you just need the following potion:\n\n1. Crossword\n2. Red Hot Chili Pepper\n3. Crossword\n\nUse this, and it will solve the puzzle.\n\n[008]: Century Puzzle\nQ: I'm stuck on the century puzzle!\n\nA: The century puzzle is a huge, wooden puzzle that acts both as a key-dispenser and a gate.\n\n1. Crossword\n2. Elmwood\n3. Crossword\n\nUse this, and the puzzle will be solved, depositing a small key at your feet. This will not open the gate portion of the puzzle, however (See Under Construction).\n\n===C:UNDER CONSTRUCTION===\n\n[101]: Queen's Cat's Ghost\nThe ghost of the Queen's Cat won't let you into the throne room. Previously, when cats have served as an obstacle in this game, we defeated them by spraying them with water, causing them to run away.\n\n[102]: Celestial Cauldron/Trojan Horse\nIn order to warm up the Celestial Potion we need to heat the Celestial Cauldron. The most plausible way to do this is to ignite the Trojan Horse which is nearby, but we can't figure out how to do that.\n\n[103]: Cave Witch\nIn order to impress the witch in the Oil Mine, we need to \"electrify the surroundings\". Our previous attempts at making lightning have failed because there's too much vaporized oil in the air.\n\n[104]: Royal Kitchen\nThe Royal Kitchen includes a well-oiled stone used for cooking flatbreads. We need to cool this cooking surface down in order to sabotage the Royal Chef's meal, but we have no leads on how to do that.\n\n[105]: Century Puzzle II\nAfter solving the century puzzle (see FAQ) we're left in the unfortunate situation of it still not opening, and it still blocks the way to the remainder of the dungeon. We've already retrieved the key from it, so at this point we just need to destroy it.\n\n[106]: Electric Chasm\nIn order to reach the palace of Countess Malace, we need to cross the electric chasm. The only reasonable candidate to create a bridge is the roots of the electric vines criss-crossing the chasm, unfortunately, they are too soft to support our weight.\n\n[107]: Balance Lock\nAfter creating a sub-zero environment and crystallizing the air in the chamber, it lands on the right-hand side of the balance machine. However, while it weighs on the lock, it doesn't push the right side far enough to open the lock. We can't influence the left side of the balance, so we clearly need to do something with the side we can access.\n\n[108]: Foundry\nIn order to create a possessed sword, we need to forge it ourselves. Obviously, this happens in the foundry. We can pour cold liquid steel into a mold to create a sword, but that won't be possessed.\n",u=!0;n.default=function(e){var n=e.puzzleData,t=Object(a.useRef)(null);return l(h.a,{title:"Alchemystery!
