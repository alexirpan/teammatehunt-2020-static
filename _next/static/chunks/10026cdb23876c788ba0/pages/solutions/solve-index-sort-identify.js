This worked, but introduced a new problem: indices got used twice, and there was no checksum to detect 1-indexing vs 0-indexing. Testsolvers would 1-index, spot words from the 1st letters of the answers, and treat that as confirmation of the sort. However, all their indices would be off by one! Recognizing 3-1-4-1-5-9 is reasonable, but error correcting 4-2-5-2-6-10 is too much to ask. The final version of the puzzle changed the Sort to be independent of Index again, with added guide rails to steer away from 1-indexing or sorting first.
