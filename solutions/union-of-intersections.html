monospace">PHILIPPINE SEA</strong>.</p><h4>Author&#x27;s Notes</h4><p class="jsx-4062274224">The original version of this puzzle was within a mini-hunt puzzle that had mini-puzzles for major cities in the Acela Corridor. The intro round puzzle <a href="../puzzles/island-metric" class="jsx-4062274224">&quot;Island Metric&quot;</a> <!-- -->was based on New York City. This one was based on Washington DC, and originally just showed pictures of states with numbers in them to represent the intersections between state avenues and numbered streets. Once it became its own separate puzzle, I needed to add another step to clue the intersections. I first tried using clues that uniquely match exactly two states, whose intersections would be at lettered streets, but a number of common letters were impossible to extract with this method. Therefore, I went back to cluing a state and a number. One of the editors suggested cluing states by a sequence of instructions, similar to the infamous MIT Mystery Hunt Puzzle “<a href="http://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/2019/puzzle/first_you_visit_burkina_faso.html" class="jsx-4062274224">First You Visit Burkina Faso</a>” (though with much easier steps). We then came up with the idea of cluing the numbered streets by giving quantitative “fun facts” that differed from the correct number by the desired street number. Since all the large state avenues are named after the first states in the Union, the journey only went through the eastern half of the country, but it was still really fun coming up with the paths between each consecutive pair of states.</p></section></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/solutions/union-of-intersections","query":{},"buildId":"jitxUitrYEqzZ6smLRhhQ","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false}</script><script nomodule="" src="/_next/static/chunks/dc82085976cbe6787319/polyfills.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/71797b91493c10c14115/main.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/69acb733d87335fd5814/webpack.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework.3bff5c4c556a06c06a67.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/e39b95a509f20ff1b15879ccf45bc66ab5055c60.e1beb375be5709a34646.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/214ba52570f9fa12be9c3ae52d7d82a642ae1774.2ba79b76faae664c86c4.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/8ea212e822c2e455e7aafa75c1d834204e14a1bc.b7030d3b1904d9ad1c0e.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/2e166dc6d3e5a9a903ab751c2778cd1e9a4afefd.41dce24f2f2d60fbc8d3.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/c4bbb591b726a8e3f229426a0e731a286e9c3f09.60c023e3b24a09cf9184.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/c8ef709cf16acf6d4499/pages/_app.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/b777525a3fce987f3b36/pages/solutions/union-of-intersections.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/jitxUitrYEqzZ6smLRhhQ/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/jitxUitrYEqzZ6smLRhhQ/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
